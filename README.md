# Zhorai
An interactive conversational agent for K-12 AI education. See the [EAAI 2020 paper about Zhorai here](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e388f0cc3c41617d66719d8/5e432a7280e474409a4c2e83_EAAI-LinP.27.pdf).

For first-time set up of the semantic parser, follow the [README](https://github.com/jessvb/zhorai/blob/master/semantic-parser/README.md)

For first-time set up of the node server,
```
cd website-backend/receive-text
npm install
```

If the semantic parser has previously been set up, you can start it with,
```
cd semantic-parser/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05
java -mx6g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -timeout 5000
```

To start the node server,
```
cd website-backend/receive-text
node receiver.js
# or use 'forever' instead of node so that it continually respawns, even if it crashes:
# forever receiver.js
```

The website uses the Bootstrap library to construct the overall site framework. Speech recognition and synthesis was implemented using the Web Speech APIâ€™s webkitSpeechRecognition interface. The mindmap and scatter plot visualizations use the D3 JavaScript library.
